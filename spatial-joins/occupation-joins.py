-Goal of this script will be to join the number of people from certain occupational 
categories to city blocks
-Inputs should be something like:
    AlbanyCE.shp (contains field occlabelB with occupations) and
    AlbanyET.shp (cotains field popDense with population density)
-Eventually we want this to walk to through a directory and do it for every file in the directory
